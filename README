interface.

GET IT

You can get the latest version from [3].

DESCRIPTION:

Control all settings of a CPiA based webcam via a nice GUI. This simple
python-gtk application allows one to control a CPiA based webcam by
means of a nice GUI. The settings are done by changing the
proc-interface of the CPiA based webcam. Apart from such a webcam you
need a special kernel-module to use this program. See the web-page[3]
for more information. The driver is in the official kernel since
version 2.2.15-pre15 and 2.3.99-pre4.

NOTE: the USB cpia-driver in the development kernels 2.3.13 up to
2.3.99-pre4 has no proc-interface. You need the driver from the
web-page given above or an official kernel with a high enough version.

REQUIREMENTS

You will need python1.5 and python-gtk 0.6.2 or later. Most stuff might
work with earlier versions of python-gtk (it was initially written with
0.5.3). The reason for 0.6.2 is that it seems to be the first version
with working threads which are used to update the camera status
(fps/thruput). You might ask 'why python, why gtk?'. I was curious
about both. So I thought this is a nice idea to learn it. It was, more
or less. The moral: before I end as a GUI-programmer I will quit
programming at all. But python and GTK are nice. ;)

FEATURES

- camera status (fps/thruput)
- setting color/brighness/contrast
- compression control (incl. manual/auto parameters)
- flicker control settings
- all possible sensor fps settings

TRY IT OUT

Just type 'cpia-control'.

INSTALLATION

Consult your local python manual. I have no idea what the standard
search paths for python programs is in your distribution. This tarball
is tailored to debian-linux.

KNOWN PROBLEMS

See TODO.
